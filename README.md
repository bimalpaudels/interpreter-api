### Python Interpreter Backend (FastAPI)

## Overview

This backend is a demonstration of the `restricted` package in action â€” built using FastAPI.

It showcases the use of `restricted`'s default configuration to safely evaluate user-submitted Python code with custom import restrictions and structured error handling. 
The API provides an endpoint to submit code and receive output, making it ideal for quick browser-based coding.

## Demo 
The frontend of this demo is hosted in Vercel.
